,,,,,,,Camerons,Camerons Cave Troglobitic Community,"A troblobitic (obligatory cave inhabitants) community inhabiting the coastal plain of the Cape Range peninsula. The community is known only from Camerons Cave (C-452)  in the Exmouth townsite.

The species assemblage is related to that found in caves in Cape Range sensu stricto (papers in Humphreys, 1993), but is quite distinct from it.  Most of the troglobitic species found there  are known from nowhere else.   These include:-

• Stygiochiropus peculiaris Shear and Humphreys (Diplopoda: Polydesmida: Paradoxosomatidae Australiosomatinae: Antichiropodini):
only known from six specimens (2 collected dead) from C-452. Three other species of the genus, which is endemic to Cape Range (Humphreys and Shear,  1993; Shear and Humphreys, 1996), occur in Cape Range sensu stricto.

• Hyella sp. nov. (Pseudoscorpionida: Hyidae): only known from the dark zone of C-452 from 4 female and one adult male specimens plus 5 immature. Specimens BES 2545;  2546;  2554; 4249;  4148; 4149;  4154;  1154;  2525. Another species of the genus, which is endemic to Cape Range (Harvey, 1993) occurs in Cape Range sensu stricto.

• An undescribed species of troglomorphic  harvestmen (Opilionida: Assamiidae)— specimens BES 2549; 4189.

• An undescribed species of troglomorphic  harvestmen (Opilionida: Phalangodidae) is only known specimen of the family Phalangodidae from Cape Range— specimen BES 2543. 

• An undescribed troglomorphic species of cave spider (Hahniidae: Araneae), known from one specimen —BES 1155. A related troglomorphic species is known from caves in Cape Range proper.

• Phaconura sp. nov. (Hemiptera: Meenoplidae), troglomorphic (H. Hoch, pers. comm.), very different from all other Phaconeura—BES 2544 . Know only from C-452.  Another species of Phaconeura occurs in caves in Cape Range proper (Hoch, 1993).

• An undescribed troglomorphic species of cave spider (Ctenidae: Araneae) known from three specimen, all juvenile —BES 2526; 2539; 2541. Related epigean and troglobitic species are known from Cape Range proper (Harvey et al. 1993).

• Draculoides bramstokeri Harvey and Humphreys (Schizomida: Hubbardiidae) is troglobitic and occurs in the cave.  This species is known from one other location in Exmouth and from Barrow Island (Harvey and Humphreys 1995).  Several other species of Schizomida are known from Cape Range caves both from the coastal plain and the range proper, mostly troglomorphic (Harvey et al. 1993; M.S. Harvey, pers. comm.).

• Trichocyclus sp. (Pholcidae: Araneae).  Species presently uncertain; known from three specimens —BES 2021; 4248.


To date all species with congeneric members in caves in Cape Range proper have proved to be quite distinct species. This cave community is recognisable by its unique composition of species of which at least • are known only from this location.


Associated Fauna
Other fauna whose status is unknown, probably epigean, occur in C-452 including:

Isopoda: Oniscoidea: Armadillidae				
Ploiaria sp.1 (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Emesinae)
? Centrogonus sp.  (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Emesinae)
Coleoptera: Trogidae				
Blattodea					
Collembola					
					
C-452 also contains an aquatic fauna including Milyeringa veritas (troglomorphic) and Copepoda: Calanoida."

Griffin & Associates (2005) noted that the 28 group (Gp 28) was perhaps the most appropriate for the purpose of differentiating ‘real’ communities on the Mt Gibson Range. He noted that communities at the 10 group level are aggregations of communities, that as aggregates mean little other than that they contain certain species in common, and the 40 group classification  could be ‘too detailed’."

,,,,,,,Point Spring and Long Swamp,Assemblages of Point Spring and Long Spring rainforest swamps,"Closed canopy rainforest on freshwater swamps on alluvial floodplain soils in the east Kimberley (Point Spring and Long Swamp).  Two occurrences are known, these are Point Spring and Long Swamp.  At Point Spring the canopy is 17m high and the dominant tree species include Canarium australianum, Carallia brachiata, Euodia elleryana, Ficus racemosa, F. virens and Terminalia sericocarpa.  Along one edge, the Point Spring rainforest extends on to the footslopes of a sandstone ridge and the spring feeds a small lake on the other side (Burbidge et al. 1991, McKenzie et al. 1991).  The rainforest canopy height at Long Swamp is 30m, and the dominant tree species include Nauclea orientalis, Terminalia sericocarpa and Euodia elleryana.  The periphery of the patch is permanently moist and supports a Melaleuca leucadendra forest (McKenzie et al. 1991).  At Point Spring the community species richness is 45, at Long Swamp it is 52.  The perennial plant species richness at Point Spring is 31, and at Long Swamp is 20.  Plants with very restricted distributions within the State include Dicliptera ciliata (herb) at Point Spring, and Mucuna gigantea (vine) and Sterculia holtzei (tree) at Long Swamp.  The lithology at both sites is quaternary alluvium and the soil is a black.  Subsurface soils are recorded as sandy-loam at Point Spring, and silty clay at Long Swamp.  In 1987, leaf litter depth was recorded as 5cm at Point Spring, and 15cm at Long Swamp (McKenzie et al. 1991).  Most of the camaenid land snails recorded in the Kimberley Rainforest Survey are restricted endemics in the Kimberley.  The median linear range for a wet area Kimberley camaenid is 20km, and 82 of the 93 camaenids were only collected in 1 to 5 patches (Solem 1991).  Consequently, these communities can be distinguished from similar rainforest communities elsewhere in northern Australia (Mr N.  McKenzie pers. comm. 2000).  In reference to Point Spring, Burbidge et al. (1991), described patches of closed canopy rainforest as so rare in the lowland environments of east Kimberley, that a variety of species depend on them for their persistence in the district."
